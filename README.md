Uses existing library code where possible, and compares "Javascript source" with code compiled from other 
languages using Emscripten or similar.

**FFT implementations**

Only forward real-to-complex are tested at this point (the inverse transforms may or may not produce the right results).

You can run these tests in a browser, either by checking out this repo and opening the file fft/index.html or by navigating to [this test page here](http://all-day-breakfast.com/js-dsp-test/fft/).

See the original Mercurial repository by Chris Cannam (from which this is cloned) [here](https://code.soundsoftware.ac.uk/projects/js-dsp-test).
